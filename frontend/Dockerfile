# Build api-client (Orval generates .ts, handled by Vite? or need tsc?)
# The user config target is '../packages/web/api-client/index.ts'.
# The package.json now points to index.ts.
# If it's used as a workspace dependency in Vite, it should handle TS sources.
# No strict build step needed for api-client if consumed by Vite.
